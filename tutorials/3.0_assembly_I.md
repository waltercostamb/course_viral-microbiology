# Assembly I

## Theory

Read about assembly in Prof. Manolis Kellis's book (pages 93 to 98): https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.047/f15/MIT6_047F15_Compiled.pdf 

## Practice

Use Metaspades to assemble the sequences: https://cab.spbu.ru/software/meta-spades/. As a basis for this experiment, you can use the following link from Dr Aldert Zomer (Section "Assembly"):  https://aldertzomer.github.io/Microbial-Genomics-2022/30_Assembly/index.html Note that he used another assembly tool. We need to adapt this tutorial to Metaspades.
