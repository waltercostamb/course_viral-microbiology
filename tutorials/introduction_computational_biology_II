# Introduction to Computational Biology II

Objectives: understand what is an algorithm and read about sequence alignment. This is one of the most important topics for computational biology and the basis for most of our 
experiments of assembly, phage identification and annotation.   

Answer the following questions with an online search:  

- What is an algorithm? 
- What is an example of algorithm?

The following book, by Prof. Manolis Kellis, was used for a course on Computational Biology and contains several topics that are relevant for our module: https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.047/f15/MIT6_047F15_Compiled.pdf

- Read pages 25 to 30 of chapter "SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING"  
- Read section "2.4.1 Theory of Dynamic Programming"
- Read section 2.4.3

If there is time:

- Read pages 34 to 39 "2.5 The Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm"
