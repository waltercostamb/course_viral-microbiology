# Pipeline of Analysis of Phage Sequences

What is a computational pipeline? Discuss with your teacher.  

You will analyse phage sequences originating from Nanopore technology. This requires a careful choice of tools and analysis order. What should you do first when you download the sequences? 
After checking for quality and filtering out low quality sequences, you should assemble and identify them.  

Write down the experiments you are doing in a graphical the form. For examples, check:  

Note that the pipeline we are doing in this module is a condensed version. For an actual project, you need more time to be able to perform each step properly. 
One example is the step of "Virus identification tools", or identification of pro-phages in the sequences. We chose VirSorter2, since one of our collaborators
is already familiar with it and can help us interprete its output. However, we know from another collaborator, that there may be other tools that
perform better. In an actual project, we would have to carefully decide which tool to use according to our specific project.
