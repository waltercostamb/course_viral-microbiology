# Morning

## Literature Research

The project you developed throughout this module had as an objective the full characterization of a bacteriophage. For that you performed wet lab experiments, assembled raw sequences, annotated the assembly and classified the phage. An important step in a characterization project is to research about the phage online. Find out what other researchers know about your phage. For that, look for your phage in the following online databases: 

------

  - PubMed
  - NCBI
  - GenBank 

------

Summarize your findings in the lab book, mention all references and add screenshots whenever relevant.

# Afternoon

- Prepare your final presentation (remember that you should present both wet and dry lab experiments!)
- Write a one-page summary of your dry lab project. Include it your lab book as the first page
