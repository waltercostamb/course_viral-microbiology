# Data Visualization

Visualization is a very important step in analyzing your data. This can be done differently, using python (matplotlib, seaborn) or R (ggplot2) for example. You will analyse the viral annotation using matplotlib.  

## Theory

-----

- What is a computational pipeline?
- What are python dictionaries and dataframes?

-----

## Practice

Using draw.io (or inkscape or another tool of you liking), draw a pipeline of analysis for you project. Follow the example of: https://www.rna-seqblog.com/a-computational-pipeline-for-cross-species-analysis-of-rna-seq-data-using-r-and-bioconductor/. Save the image in your lab book and make sure to include it in the presentation of your final project.  

Create a jupyter notebook and using python, do the following tasks:

-----

- Open the genes file produced by pharokka
- Create an object (dictionary or dataframe) with the ID of the gene as one column, the start and end of it as second and third columns
- Calculate the size of the genes by subtracting the columns and store the results in a new column
- Plot the distribution of protein sizes using matplotlib

-----

If there is time, do the next tasks:

-----

- Calculate the mean, median and standard deviation lengths of you proteins

To do these tasks, you can research online or use the book "Python Data Science Handbook" from Jake VanderPlas. The author has kindly released it online for free: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/.
