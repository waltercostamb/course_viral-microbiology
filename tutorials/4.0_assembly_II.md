## Practice

Evaluate the assembly you did yesterday with checkV: https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/checkv/src/master/.

Follow the tutorial of "Sequence Quality" chapter of Dr Aldert Zomer's course: https://aldertzomer.github.io/Microbial-Genomics-2022/50_Assembly_Quality/index.html. Adapt the tutorial to use checkv instead of checkm.

Finally, answer the following question:

----

Is the assemble complete or fragmented?
