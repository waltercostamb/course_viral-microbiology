# Data Visualization

Visualization is a very important step in analyzing your data. This can be done differently, using python (matplotlib, seaborn) or R (ggplot2) for example. You will analyse the viral annotation using matplotlib.  

## Theory

-----

- What is a computational pipeline?
- What are python dictionaries and dataframes?

-----

## Practice

Using draw.io (or inkscape or another tool of you liking), draw a pipeline of analysis for you project. Follow the example of: https://www.rna-seqblog.com/a-computational-pipeline-for-cross-species-analysis-of-rna-seq-data-using-r-and-bioconductor/. Save the image in your lab folder and make sure to include it in the presentation of your final project.  

Create a jupyter notebook and using python, do the following tasks:

-----

- Open your proteins file
- Create an object (dictionary or dataframe) with the ID of the protein in one columns and the size of the protein in the second column
- Plot the distribution of protein sizes using matplotlib
- Calculate the mean, median and standard deviation lengths of you proteins
- Calculate the aminoacid usage of your proteins. For that, calculate the overall frequency of each residue and plot it in a histogram

To do these tasks, you can research online or use the book "Python Data Science Handbook" from Jake VanderPlas. The author has kindly released it online for free: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/.
