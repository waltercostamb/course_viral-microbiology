# Data Visualization

Visualization is a very important approach to analyze your data. This can be done with different approaches, such as R or python. You will analyse the viral annotation using visualization.  

## Theory

-----

- What is a computational pipeline?
- What are python dictionaries and dataframes?

-----

## Practice

Using draw.io (or inkscape or another tool of you liking), draw a pipeline of analysis for you project. As an example, check: https://www.rna-seqblog.com/a-computational-pipeline-for-cross-species-analysis-of-rna-seq-data-using-r-and-bioconductor/. Save the image in your lab folder and make sure to include it in the presentation of your final project.  

Create a jupyter notebook and using python, do the following tasks:

-----

- Open your proteins file
- Create an object (dictionary or dataframe) with the ID of the protein in one columns and the size of the protein in the second column
- Plot the distribution of protein sizes of your virus using matplotlib
- What is the mean, median and standard deviation lengths of you proteins?
- What is the aminoacid usage of your proteins? Do answer that, calculate the overall frequency of each residue and plot it in a histogram

To do these tasks, you can research online or use the book "Python Data Science Handbook" from Jake VanderPlas. The author has kindly released it online for free: https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/.
