# Classification of Phages

## Theory

Skim the VirSorter2 paper: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00990-y

Skip the details and focus on the most important parts. Answer the following questions:

----

- What was done in this paper?
- Why?
- How was it done? Which methods were used?
- What was the main contribution to the scientific community?
- Des VirSorter2 uses any databases to perform its analysis? If so, which?

----

Importantly, for VirSorter2 and all of the tools you use for your project, it is important that you understand their internal workings. Which databases are used, and which methods? **Write all of this in your lab book**, citing references. Add this information in your slides for the final project presentation. This is important when discussing results and considerig if the methods are appropriate for the experiments.  

## Practice 

Identify the sequenced phage using VirSorter2. To do that follow the tutorial: https://www.protocols.io/view/getting-started-with-virsorter2-rm7vz8rm5vx1/v2

----

- What is the sequence's most likely viral group, considering the tools' output metrics?
- What is the sequence's most likely taxonomy group? If the tool does not answer that, try BLAST or another tool
