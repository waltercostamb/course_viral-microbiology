# Documentation Theory

Documenting your work is crucial in Computational Biology/Bioinformatics. In this way you can make sure that your work is reproducible, you can transfer text to other documents, such as reports or papers and other people can access your work.  

Take a look at the following repository: https://github.com/waltercostamb/Lab-Book to know more about work organization. You are required to write a Lab Book for Part B of the module. This Lab Book must be in a computational format (docx, google docs, markdown, latex, etc.). You should divide the lab book into sections (days) and add subsections for different tasks. Each subsection should have a meaningful title. At the top of each subsection you should add a box with important information such as websites used in searches, folders where you can find files and tool names and versions. An example follows below. Start your lab book today and write on it whenever necessary during the course. In the final day, you are required to send a copy to your advisor.
