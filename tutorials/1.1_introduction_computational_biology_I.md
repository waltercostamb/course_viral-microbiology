# Introduction to Computational Biology I

## Basic concepts

Read the following articles discussing the concepts of computational biology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology and  Watch the following video for a small introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Ov2cUaYQY Answer the following questions:

--------------

- What is computational biology?
- Why is it important?
- How did the human genome project influenced the 20th century technological development?

--------------

Afterwards, discuss with your teacher what you learned, including what is the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. What are the roles of biologists and computer scientists in this research area? How can they collaborate? 

## Sequencing

Explore the following wiki to learn about sequencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing read the introduction, a couple of applications, "The four canonical bases"
and "Nanopore DNA sequencing".

Go to youtube, and watch the following videos: "How nanopore sequencing works" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcP85JHLmnI, "Nanopore DNA sequencing" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9-Rm5AoZGw, "DNA sequencing" by Prof Bas E. Dutilh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxVDy0lSAE, "Basic file formats in bioinformatics" by Prof Bas E. Dutilh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4WDdAbZW1Y. Afterwards answer the questions below.  

Importantly: choose your sources wisely. Information is available online in bulk. It is your job as a scientist to be able to discern good and bad quality material. In this module, you will practise and develop this ability. Material produced by Universities, research centers or trustworthy newspapers are usually trustworthy. However, even then you should always apply your own judgement. When in doubt, ask colleagues or more experienced people.
