# Introduction to Computational Biology I

Read the following articles discussing the concepts of computational biology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology and data analysis applied to biology: https://waltercostamb.github.io/blog/2020/04/07/data-analysis-python Watch the following video for a small introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-Ov2cUaYQY answer the following questions:

--------------

- What is computational biology?
- Why is it important?
- What are some ethical implications for computational analysis?
- How did the human genome project influenced the 20th century technological development?

--------------

Afterwards, discuss with your teacher what you learned, including what is the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. What are the roles of biologists and computer scientists in this research area? How can they collaborate? 

Explore the following wiki to learn about sequencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing Tips: skip "Basic methods", read the introduction, some of the applications, history and "High-throughput methods", but skip specific methods.

Go to youtube, and watch videos about High-throughput/Next Generation Sequencing, for example: lectures "DNA sequencing" by Prof Bas E. Dutilh: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdxVDy0lSAE and "Basic file formats in bioinformatics" by Prof Bas E. Dutil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4WDdAbZW1Y. Afterwards answer the questions below.  

Important to note is: choose your sources wisely. Information is available online in bulk. It is your job as a scientist to be able to discern good and bad quality material. In this module, you will practise and develop this ability. Material produced by Universities, research centers or trustworthy newspapers are usually trustworthy. However, even then you should always apply your own judgement. When in doubt, ask colleagues or more experienced people.

- What are the basic principles of DNA sequencing?
- What are the basic steps for nanopore sequencing? 
- What is the output of nanopore?
- How to interpret FASTQ format?
