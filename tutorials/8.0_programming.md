# Morning

## Programming

You already programmed a bit in your project by visualizing your data. Today you will continue with programming by applying a statistical test. Do the following tasks:  

------

- Download from NCBI 10 genomes of the order Crassvirales: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/?term=crassvirales
- Download from NCBI 9 more genomes of the same order as your virus's

-------

Using the same jupyter notebook your started before, create a table with the ID of the phage in one column, the order of the phage in another column and the length of the genome in a third column. Apply a statistical test to see if the lenghts of the genomes of the two orders differ. You can assume that the distributions are not normal and apply a non-parametric test such as Mann Whitney U test.   

**Importantly**: some of these tasks may take longer than a single morning, so prioritize the tasks assigned for each period (morning or afternoon). If you do not finish everything listed here in the morning, it is not a problem.

# Afternoon

- Prepare your final presentation
- Do some final improvements in you lab book and scripts if necessary
