# Introduction to Computational Biology II

Read the following articles discussing the concepts of computational biology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology and data analysis applied to biology: https://waltercostamb.github.io/blog/2020/04/07/data-analysis-python Make sure to understand what is computational biology, why is it important, ethical implications for computational analysis and how the human genome project influenced the 20th century technological development. Afterwards, discuss with your teacher what you learned, including what is the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. What are the roles of biologists and computer scientists in this research area? How can they collaborate? 

Explore the following wiki to learn about sequencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing Tips: skip "Basic methods", read the introduction,some of the applications,
history and "High-throughput methods", but skip specific methods.

Go to youtube, and watch videos about Sanger and High-throughput or Next Generation Sequencing. Choose the material well. Information is available online in bulk. 
It is your job as a scientist to be able to discern good and bad quality material. In this course, you will practise and develop this ability. Material produced by Universities, research centers or trustworthy newspapers are usually good. However, even in these cases you should always apply your own judgement. When in doubt, ask colleagues or more experienced people. After watching the videos, summarize what you learned to your teacher and discuss important topics with them, including any unclear topics. Make sure to understand the following topics about sequencing:

- Basic principles of DNA sequencing
- Basic steps for nanopore sequencing
- What is the output of the nanopore?
- How to interprete FASTQ format?
