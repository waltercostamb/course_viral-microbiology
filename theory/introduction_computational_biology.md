# Introduction to Computational Biology

Read the following wiki article explaining the concept of Computational Biology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology After reading, make sure 
to understand what is Computational Biology, why is it important and how the human genome project influenced the 20th century technological development. 
Additionally, discuss with your teacher about the difference between Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. What are the roles of biologists and computer scientists 
in this research area? How can they collaborate? 

Explore the following wiki to learn about sequencing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing Tips: skip "Basic methods", read the introduction,some of the applications,
history and "High-throughput methods", but skip specific methods.

Go to youtube, and watch videos about Sanger and High-throughput or Next Generation Sequencing. Choose the material well. Information is available online in bulk. 
It is your job as a scientist to be able to discern good and bad quality material. In this course, you will practise and develop this ability. Material produced by Universities,
research centers or trustworthy newspapers are usually good. However, even in these cases you should always apply your own judgement. When in doubt, ask colleagues or 
more experienced people. Afterwards, summarize what you learned to your teacher and discuss important topics with them, including any unclear topics.
