# Advanced Module "Viral Microbiology"

This repository contains information about the advanced module "Viral Microbiology" of the Masters program in Microbiology of the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena. The first version of this module contains two parts: wet and dry lab. Each part is consisted of 60 hours work to be completed in two weeks. Theory will be covered in the morning and practice in the afternoon. This repository contains information regarding the second part. In the dry lab, we will focus on Computational Biology/Bioinformatics applied to bacteriophages. The following topics will be covered:  

- Introduction to Computational Biology/Bioinformatics
- Documentation and Lab Book
- Analysis of sequencing quality
- Cleaning of sequences
- Sequence assembly
- Identification of phages
- Sequence annotation
- Finding potential hosts for bacteriophages

At the end of this module the student should be able to:

- assemble bacteriophage genome sequences from raw data;
- identify bacteriophages;
- annotate the genomes;
- find potential hosts;
- analyze and interprete bacteriophage genomic data;
- document your work in a reproduceable way;
- present a cross-disciplinary scientific project.

The evaluation of the student will be based on:

- Quality of bioinformatics analysis in terms of reproducibility (Lab Book and commented scripts): 50%
- Presentation of the final project (50%)
