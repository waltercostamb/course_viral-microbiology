# Advanced Module "Viral Microbiology": Part B

This repository contains information about Part B of the advanced module "Viral Microbiology" of the Masters program in Microbiology of the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena. The module "Viral Microbiology" is divided into two parts: A, wet lab and B, dry lab. Part B is consisted of 60 hours work to be completed in two weeks. Theory will be covered in the morning and practice in the afternoon. We will focus on Computational Biology/Bioinformatics applied to bacteriophages. The following topics will be covered:  

- Introduction to Computational Biology/Bioinformatics
- Documentation and Lab Book
- Analysis of sequencing quality
- Cleaning of sequences
- Sequence assembly
- Identification of phages
- Sequence annotation

At the end of this module the student should be able to:

- know basic concepts about computational biology
- assemble bacteriophage genome sequences from raw data;
- identify bacteriophages;
- annotate the genomes;
- document dry lab work in a reproduceable way;
- present a cross-disciplinary scientific project.

The evaluation of the student will be based on:

- Wet lab activities (to be defined by the wet lab teachers): 25%
- Dry lab: quality of documentation and reproducibility of experiments as seen in the student's Lab Book, which should contain commented scripts and summary of discussions with the teacher: 25%
- Presentation of the final project: 50%
