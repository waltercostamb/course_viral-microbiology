# Study Material

Here is indicated some extra study material with topics that are relevant to Part B of the module. It is expected that you do not understand all of the material, especially if you have not learned informatics beforehand. Therefore, write down any unclear points and terms and clarify them later with your teacher. Focus on new information that is clear, so that you start building a feeling for this new topic.
