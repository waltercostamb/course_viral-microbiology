# Study Material

We indicate here some study material to prepare for module B. If you already have basic knowledge about linux and bash (command line), you can skip this tutorial. If not, please read the pages below and watch the video. It is not necessary to do the exercises, but read the practical part of the pages as well.   

It is not expected that you fully understand all of the material. The idea is for you to get an initial view of linux and bash before the module starts.
